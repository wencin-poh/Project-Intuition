the undergraduate and graduate levels both in person and online. He is published in many 
of the top journals in his research field of combinatorics including <em>Algebraic Combinatorics</em>,
<em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory--Series A</em> (now <em>Combinatorial Theory</em>), <em>
Electronic Journal of Combinatorics</em>, <em>Contributions to Discrete Math</em>, and 
<em>Australasian Journal of Combinatorics</em>.
