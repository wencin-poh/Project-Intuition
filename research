    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Research</h1>
    <p>
In order to improve the educational experience, we need to know what works and what doesn't. Towards this
end, we are engaging in two types of research around the effectiveness of our product.  The first type of 
research involves the careful collection, interpretation, and analysis of data combed from students' interaction
with our product.  Because of the interactive nature of our product we are able to collect not only data 
on student responses to the questions in our modules but also statistics on how students interact with 
the modules themselves.  
</P>
<P>


For those curious to know how this actually works here is a short overview:  The content of Project Intuition 
is stored on a server.  When a user navigates to our website, files are sent to the user's browser, which then
compiles those files and displays the result.  At this point the user can view all of our content, interact with
modules and answer questions without any additional flow of data between the server and the browser. However, by 
keeping a connection open between the browser and the server, we are able to send data associated to student 
behavior back to the server.  The server then interprets this data and stores it to a database.  

Whenever needed (such as when a user clicks the "Question Statistics" link in each module) the browser sends 
a request to the server to look up the relevant information in the database.  After retrieving the data, the 
server sends the requested information back to the browser which can then be used to improve the user's 
experience.

    In addition, we at Project Intuition have direct access to the contents of the database.  This allows us to make
    adjustments to our modules (as a simple example, if a question is only correctly answered 5% of the time, this 
    tells us the question is too difficult, worded poorly, or confusing for another reason and needs to be re-evaluated).
    Since Project Intuition courses are designed to be taken corequisitely with their associated undergraduate math 
    courses we plan to eventually link our own data to student performance metrics gathered by the instructor of the associated
    in person math course including data such as test scores and class attendance.  In this way we can see if there
    is a correlation between use of our product and improved performance, and, if so, exactly what aspects of our
    product appear to be most helpful.

</p>

<p>
The second type of research that we are engaging in involves reviewing the current literature in the 
field of mathematics education to help inform the construction of our product.
