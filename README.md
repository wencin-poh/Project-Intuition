# Project Intuition

These are the current files for the website projectintuition.org.  These are initial versions and not yet well documented.  Eventually they will be replaced by cleaner and more well-documented versions.

The files in this repository belong to one of 5 folders:

1. Modules: Contains HTML/CSS and javaScript for each module appearing on projectintuition.org 
2. Bios: Contains HTML for the bios of Graham, Wencin, and Jeff
3. Pages: Contains HTML/CSS for all other pages of the website
4. Styles-and-scripts: Contains CSS and javaScript that is used by various pages
5. backend: Contains PHP code used to link projectintuition to a SQL database

The authors of this project include Graham Hawkes, Wencin Poh, and Jeff Nichols.   Each folder contains a Credit file which assigns credit to Graham, Wencin, and/or Jeff for each of the files in that folder.  These assignments are estimates, they do not cover all contributions of each individual member to the project. 

Additional contributions not specified within the folders:

Wencin: Setting up MathJax for mathematical equations in the modules <br>
Wencin: Researching funding opportunities and applying for funding <br>
Jeff: Researching relevant literature in education <br>
Jeff: Creating instructional videos to accompany modules <br>
In addition all members attend weekly meetings to provide feedback to the other team members.
