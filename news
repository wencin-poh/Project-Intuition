<h4><u>February 2, 2023:</u>  Hello World.  Here is the first status update from Project Intuition:</h4>
<p>
We have now completed the software foundation on which we plan to construct our product.  This includes 
the structure of the site, the format of the modules, the basic scripts needed for interactivity
and assessment along with a SQL database for recording user statistics and a two way data pipeline 
for recording data to, and retrieving data from, the database.
</p>
<p>
We have also begun construction on our first lab course which will be Linear Algebra.  So far we have completed 
modules 1-6 of a planned 20-25.  We hope to have this initial course done by the beginning of the 2023 spring quarter 
for universities in the Western U.S. in order to begin collecting data at that point.  This data will help us to 
improve the linear algebra course and will inform our construction of future courses.
</p>
